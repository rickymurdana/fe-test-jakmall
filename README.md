# fe-test-jakmall

Build with React Typescript.

This as a technical test for Frontend Developer position at jakmall.com. What a experience and I learned a lot during the process, so I want to thank jakmall.com for giving me this test. And yes, I googled a lot too. There's so many things to be learned forward. In this project I believe the code is not readable and scalable but I'll keep practice to make the code readable and scalable.

Finally, thank you for giving me the chance to show my technical skill. I hope the best for both of us.

Thanks!
